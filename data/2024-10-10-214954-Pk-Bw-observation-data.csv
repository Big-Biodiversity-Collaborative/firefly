These notes document the most important observations, i.e., those that summarize Climax activity, which were taken on 18-20 August '23, on the four sites known to have held the highest density in the TNHP area since initiation of observations by T.  Palmer in 1921. 

The orchard and fallow field showed relatively negligible numbers during all three periods, but significantly, at the onset of Maturation, the orchard presented the first emergers of the year indicating that eggs were laid there last year. Emergences must have also occurred elsewhere certainly, but these localities weren't given daily observation as was the orchard during public viewings held by the TNHC staff (17-24 July). 

The cul-de-sac, SCR, and the deAnza trail S of Santa Gertrudis, presented the best behavioral observations of all during the August 18-21 dates and, since the season is nearing its end, are therefore considered Climactic. Each location showed ground-to-ground synchrony, ground-t-o-air synchrony and short-lived, mid (1-2 yards)- to long ( 3-5 yards) distance entrainment. These male-male communications did not consummate in a lek- they did not contract into a well defined arena with coherent flash exchanges as described in Cicero (1983), but they did indicate the potential to do so if only the ff were to settle into optimum surface structure to facilitate such interactions. Tall grass and weeds, rough ground with rocks and fallen branches, moon, Nogales lights, and many other itemizable impediments and suppressing factors were present. There were areas with what is estimated to have optimum structure based on the 1983 arena, such as the northwest corner of the orchard, and the S.Gertrudis site, but for reasons unknown, congregations did not ensue. Next year, 2024, we must marshall our efforts into running experiments designed to foment lek formation so that we can document by video the escapades within.",,unreviewed
