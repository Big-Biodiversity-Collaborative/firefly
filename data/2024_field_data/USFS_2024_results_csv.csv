Fossil Creek,Fossil Springs at Admin Camp,"Janie Agyagos, Kayla Long, Eve Berlinsky, Thomas Kroll",6/3/24,None,34.420343,-111.58022,,,,"Possibly too early for fireflies. Dense riparian vegetation and travertine dams (deep pools) make it impossible to survey in riparian and have a view up or downstream. Set up survey in open area in uplands immeadiately adjacent to riparian hoping to see them rise out of riparian. Basically a wilderness area with steady visitation by people, but they stay in a few areas. The rest is wild and complex habitat!",
